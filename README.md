## An online, multiplayer, proof-of-concept platformer built on Pygame and Firebase

Built in 2017 as part of my A-Level Computer Science project to help grow my Python skills and learn the Pygame library. The project includes an online leaderboard, support for user accounts, gamerpics, online multi-player between two players powered by a real-time database. In terms of the gameplay, there are enemies, boosts, rewards, and up to 10 lives per game. 

_This is just a rough concept for the game, and it has several bugs._
